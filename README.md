## üìÅ Project Structure (Tasks 1‚Äì9)

| Task | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Visualizing the Colorization Process | Visualizes intermediate stages of colorization to understand how grayscale images are progressively turned into colored outputs. |
| **2** | Colorize Different Image Categories | Applies the model to a variety of image types like portraits, animals, and landscapes. |
| **3** | Conditional Image Colorization | Enables user-defined colors (e.g., blue sky, green grass) using a GUI for interactive control. |
| **4** | Dataset Augmentation for Colorization | Uses augmentation (rotation, flip, brightness) to improve model performance. Includes before-and-after comparison. |
| **5** | Artistic Style Transfer in Colorization | Blends style transfer with colorization, allowing users to choose artistic styles via GUI. |
| **6** | Interactive User-Guided Colorization | Users can select image regions and specify colors dynamically through an interactive GUI. |
| **7** | Real-time Multi-Object Colorization | Employs semantic segmentation to colorize multiple real-time objects like trees, cars, etc., in video streams. |
| **8** | Time-Based Historical Colorization | Detects the historical era (e.g., 1900s, 1950s) and colorizes images using era-specific palettes. |
| **9** | Cross-Domain Image Colorization | Colorizes sketches, infrared images, and other domain-specific inputs using appropriate techniques. |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note About Files

Due to GitHub's file size limit, some files were removed from version control:
- Pretrained models (`*.pt`)
- Landmark predictors (`*.dat`)
- Large video files (`*.mp4`)

> You can manually download these files from [Google Drive](#) *(link to be added)* and place them in the appropriate folders.
